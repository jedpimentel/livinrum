This is an image gallery app that allows image compositions to be downloaded as a JSON file. Which can be used to restore a previous composition.



You can load images to the site using the upload button, or by dragging the files onto the browser window.
Load the images you want to show off in-order, and then click on the "download" button to receive a "livin.rum" file which contains the image composition as a single file.

"LIVINRUM" is a digital arts collective based in the Dominican Republic.

The Livinrum website is meant as a way to make digital image compositions, like an art gallery.

What does this do?
You can load images to the site using the upload button, or by dragging the files onto the browser window.
Load the images you want to show off in-order, and then click on the "download" button to receive a "livin.rum" file which contains the image composition as a single file.

This ".rum" file is actually a JSON file that contains images and positions, and can be used to re-populate a scene.

Why?
This is a proof-of-concept content-management-system for 3D image galleries. Most of the technology used should also work on conventional sites, the 3D aspect is just a presentation layer.

Known Bugs:
THREE.js/WebGL complains if image pixelage isn't a power of 2 (ex: 512x512, 1024x1024);
images are are all rended at a 1:1 image ratio


Upcoming Features:
Ability to rotate and reposition images
View mode: loads a server-side ".rum" file by default and locks users from uploading more files;
